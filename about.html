	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I prefer to live quietly, and as a result there aren't many exciting things to say. I am presently unemployed while my focus is on finishing education, and am planning on going into system administration or other database related work. I am a bit of a traveler, at least within the United States, and tend to enjoy long road trips to the corners of the country.</p>
	<p>I spent a few years in the Boy Scouts, and spend time helping out with the family business by tending to dogs. My free time is usually spent in the company of friends, playing games, or reading, though I do occasionally write, as well.
