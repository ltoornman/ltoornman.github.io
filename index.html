	<h2>Resume</h2>
	<p>
			<h4>Class Schedule/Experience:</h4>
				Aside from this class, I am enrolled in Software development II.
				My past IT classes include web technologies, advanced databases, networking, and core programming classes.
				For meeting times: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the early afternoons are the best times, and I'm available after 10:00 AM, and 1:50 PM on Monday. Weekends are also free
	</p>
	<p>
		<h4>Work Experience:</h4>
		I have little field experience with HTML and CSS, the most I have done being an assistant to professional web designers, offering secondary front end opinions.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h4>Strengths and Weaknesses:</h4>
		My coding talents in the likes of Java are adequate, but nothing substantial. My strengths are in MySQL and other Database aspects, where I have the most practice and am most up to date on language standards. I am good at the big picture when it comes to planning things out, but the details are less of a strong suit.
